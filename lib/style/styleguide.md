### Contentful Styleguide

Here we will gather common UI elements so they can be easily used for the development of custom widgets.

You can include the stylesheet as
~~~html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://contentful.github.io/ui-extensions-sdk/cf-extension.css">
~~~

We also distribute the CSS file as part of the NPM package. You can find in in
`./dist/cf-extension.css`.
